# Neighbourhood Map Project

The Neighbourhood Map Project is a challenging way to demonstrate knowledge of Async API requests, error handling and framework usage. 

Google Maps API was used to display the neighbourhood, markers and infoWindows.

Foursquare API came very handy to retrieve data from the venues.

And the power of the Knockout JS framework was used for filtering the search results, populating and adding functionality to the markers list.


# How do I run the App?

You can start the app by downloading the files and opening "index.html" 


## What the app for?

The app is intended for exploring different food options in beautiful downtown Montevideo, Uruguay.


## How do I explore?

You can do so by clicking on the markers that appear on-screen or by clicking the list items on the left!


## There's too many markers, is there a way to filter the results?

Sure! You can do so by performing a search also on the left hand of the screen, above the marker list.
